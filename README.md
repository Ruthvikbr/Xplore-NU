### CI Pipeline Configuration Highlights ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Structure**:  
  Each workflow file (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) has:
    1. A **name** (e.g., ‚ÄúUnit Testing workflow‚Äù).
    2. **Triggers** (e.g., `on: pull_request: branches: [ dev ]`).
    3. **Jobs** that run on `ubuntu-latest` with steps:
        - **Checkout** your repo
        - **Set up JDK** (actions/setup-java@v4)
        - **Create `local.properties`** from Secrets
        - **Cache Gradle** dependencies (actions/cache@v3)
        - **Run Gradle tasks** (`test`, `bundleRelease`, signing, deployment, etc.)

- **Actions**:
    - [actions/checkout@v4](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
    - [actions/setup-java@v4](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
    - [actions/cache@v3](https://github.com/actions/cache)
    - [r0adkll/sign-android-release@v1](https://github.com/r0adkll/sign-android-release)
    - [r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1.1.3](https://github.com/r0adkll/upload-google-play)

- **Outputs**:
    - **Build logs** and **test results** in the GitHub Actions UI.
    - A new **signed `.aab`** uploaded to Google Play‚Äôs internal track if on `qa`.

- **Containers/Environments**:
    - Runs in an ephemeral Ubuntu container provided by GitHub (`ubuntu-latest`).
    - Java 17 is installed via `actions/setup-java`.

## 5. Conclusion

By combining these two GitHub Actions workflows, we have a streamlined CI/CD process:

- **Every Pull Request to `dev`**:
    - Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
    - **No deployment**; meant for code validation.

- **Every Push to `qa`**:
    - Runs the same unit tests.
    - On success, increments the version, builds a release bundle, signs it, and uploads to the Google Play **internal testing** track for QA.
